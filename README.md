# Random MOTD
A simple plugin to randomize your server's MOTD easily.

Works on both [Folia](https://papermc.io/software/folia/) and [Paper/Spigot](https://papermc.io/).

Originally made for my server [Velocity](https://www.velocity.lat/).

## Example

## Installation
- Head over to [Releases](https://github.com/azecx/RandomMOTD/releases) and download the latest one.
- Put the jar in your `plugins/` folder.
- You now have Random MOTD installed!

## Usage
- Customize the `randomMOTD/config.yml` and add MOTD's in `randomMOTD/motds.txt`.
- Use `/rmotd reload` to reload the MOTD's. (Requires permission `randommotd.reload`)
